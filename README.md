I figured I'd write a small blurb here to give some context behind this project. I don't really know what originally inspired me, but I started thinking about a webtoon/manga kind of scrolling storyboard. Then some friends and I went to Japan, and I compiled our pictures for this concept. I used some janky animation filter from my phone's camera app and threw our images into this storyboard. All in all I think it's a cool little effect and something pretty unique at the time.
